# ResNet Hologram Generator

![Animated Tweezers](moving_tweezers.gif)

This project uses a ResNet-based CNN to rapidly generate phase-only holograms for creating and moving optical tweezer arrays. It includes scripts to generate movement paths, process the dataset, train the model, and analyze the final tweezer quality.
